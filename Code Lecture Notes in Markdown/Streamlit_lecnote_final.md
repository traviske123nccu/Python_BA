# App Interface Design with Streamlit

## Disclaimer
1. This `.ipynb` file is not meant for the viewer to download directly and run the cells!
   
2. This is a seperate file to describe the lines of code building the Application. The purpose is to give the viewer or potential collaborator in the future a user manual of our code, and this very file is the second part of it.

3. If you run this file directly, it will first generate errors beacuse the packages aren't imported and the functions that we defined is not written in this very file. All of which are written in the seperate `.ipynb` file named `functions_lecnote.ipynb`, which can be seen as the previous chapter of the user manual.

## Part 1 Logo & Setting up / Initializing User Data Base

### Code Explanation

The `USER_DB` initialization block handles loading and preparing user data for the application.

1. A variable `logo_url` stores the URL of an image icon used in the app‚Äôs header, which will be displayed in the Streamlit interface.

2. A variable `USER_DB_PATH` is assigned the value `"user_db.json"` to specify the local file used for saving and loading user data.

3. The script checks if the file at `USER_DB_PATH` exists using `os.path.exists()`:
   - If it exists, the file is opened in read mode and parsed using `json.load(f)` to populate the `USER_DB` dictionary.
   - If it does not exist, a default dictionary `USER_DB` is created manually with sample users.

4. Each user in `USER_DB` (e.g., `"alice"` and `"bob"`) contains the following fields:
   - `"password"`: a plain text password for login
   - `"gender"`: either `"male"` or `"female"`
   - `"age"`: numeric value in years
   - `"height"`: height in centimeters
   - `"weight"`: weight in kilograms
   - `"activity_level"`: one of `"inactive"`, `"low active"`, `"active"`, or `"very active"`
   - `"goal"`: either `"fat_loss"` or `"muscle_gain"` to indicate their objective


```python
# --- Logo Link ---
logo_url = "https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/590/590685.png"  # Logo URL used in Streamlit header

# --- File path for user DB persistence ---
USER_DB_PATH = "user_db.json"  # Local file to persist user data

# --- Load user DB from file if exists ---
if os.path.exists(USER_DB_PATH):
    with open(USER_DB_PATH, "r") as f:
        USER_DB = json.load(f)             # Load user data from JSON file
else:
    USER_DB = {                            # If file doesn't exist, initialize in-memory user DB
        "alice": {
            "password": "1234",            # Simple password (not secure for real apps)
            "gender": "female",
            "age": 28,
            "height": 160,                 # in cm
            "weight": 55,                  # in kg
            "activity_level": "active",    # User-reported activity level
            "goal": "fat_loss"             # Goal: either "fat_loss" or "muscle_gain"
        },
        "bob": {
            "password": "5678",
            "gender": "male",
            "age": 30,
            "height": 175,
            "weight": 70,
            "activity_level": "inactive",
            "goal": "muscle_gain"
        }
    }
```

#### Line 9

1. `open(USER_DB_PATH, "r")`

    `open()` is a built-in Python function used to open a file.
    
    `"r"` is the mode, which stands for read. It means you want to read the file, not write to or modify it.

    `USER_DB_PATH` is the file path ‚Äî in this case, `"user_db.json"`, which is a JSON file used to store user data.

2. `with ... as f:`

    This is Python's `with` statement, which ensures the file is properly closed after being opened ‚Äî even if an error occurs.
    
    `f` is the name given to the file object. You can use it to read the contents of the file.


## Part 2 Laying Out the Page and Setting What Goes to the Header

### Code Explanation

The Streamlit setup and header display logic ensures a polished layout with branding.

1. The `st.set_page_config(layout="centered")` function configures the Streamlit page layout so that all content is centered. This enhances visual balance and makes the app look more professional on all screen sizes.

2. The line `col_logo, col_title = st.columns([2, 6])` creates a layout with two columns using Streamlit‚Äôs layout API. The first column (1/4 width) is for the logo, and the second column (3/4 width) is for the title and subtitle text.

3. Inside the `with col_logo:` block, the logo image stored at `logo_url` is rendered using `st.image()`, scaled to a width of 150 pixels to fit cleanly into the layout.

4. The `with col_title:` block renders the following elements:
   - `st.markdown("## Nutrition Scoring App 2.5.3")`: A markdown-based header for the app title.
   - `st.caption("Your personalized guide to smarter food choices!")`: A short descriptive subtitle under the title.
   - `st.caption("A Python Project Created by Group 02 with Python and Streamlit")`: A final caption crediting the development team and tools used.


```python
# --- Streamlit page setup ---
st.set_page_config(layout="centered")  # Set layout to centered (better visual balance)

# --- Header with logo aligned to title ---
col_logo, col_title = st.columns([2, 6])  # Two columns: logo (1/4 width), title (3/4 width)

with col_logo:
    st.image(logo_url, width=150)  # Display logo image at defined width

with col_title:
    st.markdown("## Nutrition Scoring App 2.5.3")  # Main title (Markdown style)
    st.caption("Your personalized guide to smarter food choices!")  # Subtitle or tagline
    st.caption("A Python Project Created by Group 02 with Python and Streamlit")  # Credit line
```

## Part 3 Logging in

### Code Explanation

The `login/register` interface uses Streamlit session state to manage user authentication and persist login data across interactions.

1. The code first checks whether the key `"logged_in"` exists in `st.session_state`. If it doesn't, it initializes the login state by setting `st.session_state.logged_in = False`.

2. If the user is not logged in, the app displays a login/registration form. A radio button `st.radio()` lets the user choose between `"Login"` and `"Register"` modes.

3. In `"Login"` mode:
   - Two text input fields collect the `username` and `password`, with password input masked.
   - When the `"Login"` button is clicked:
     - It verifies the entered credentials by checking if the `username` exists in `USER_DB` and the stored password matches.
     - If valid, it sets three session state variables: `logged_in`, `user_profile`, and `username`, and triggers a rerun using `st.rerun()`.
     - If the login fails, it shows an error message using `st.error()`.

4. In `"Register"` mode:
   - Three password fields are displayed to input a `username`, `new_pass`, and `confirm_pass`.
   - Additional profile information is collected using input fields and dropdowns:
     - `gender`, `age`, `height`, `weight`, `activity_level`, and `goal`.

5. Upon clicking `"Register"`:
   - The program performs a series of checks:
     - If the `username` already exists in `USER_DB`, show a username conflict error.
     - If `new_pass` and `confirm_pass` do not match, show a password mismatch error.
     - If the username is shorter than 3 characters or password shorter than 4, show a warning.
   - If all checks pass:
     - A new user record is added to `USER_DB` with all profile info.
     - It tries to save `USER_DB` to disk using `json.dump()` inside a `try-except` block.
     - On success, it updates the session state and displays a success message.

6. Finally, `st.stop()` is called to prevent the rest of the app from rendering unless the user has successfully logged in.



```python
# --- Track login state ---
if "logged_in" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.logged_in = False  # Initialize login state

# --- Show login/register form if not logged in ---
if not st.session_state.logged_in:
    st.markdown("## üîê Member Access")
    auth_mode = st.radio("Choose action", ["Login", "Register"])

    # --- Login form ---
    if auth_mode == "Login": # What shows if user choose the Login action
        username = st.text_input("Username")
        password = st.text_input("Password", type="password")

        if st.button("Login"): # What happens next if user hits the Login button
            if username in USER_DB and USER_DB[username]["password"] == password:
                st.session_state.logged_in = True # Change the session state from not logged in to logged in
                st.session_state.user_profile = USER_DB[username]  # Load full user data
                st.session_state.username = username
                st.rerun()
            else:
                st.error("‚ùå Invalid username or password")

    # --- Registration form ---
    elif auth_mode == "Register": # What shows if user choose the Register action
        new_user = st.text_input("Choose a username(at least 3 characters)")
        new_pass = st.text_input("Create a password(at least 4 characters)", type="password")
        confirm_pass = st.text_input("Confirm password(at least 4 characters)", type="password")

        # Profile information fields
        st.markdown("### üìã Profile Info")
        col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
        with col1:
            gender = st.selectbox("Biological Sex", ["male", "female"])
            age = st.number_input("Age", 1, 99, 25)
            height = st.number_input("Height (cm)", 100, 250, 165)
        with col2:
            weight = st.number_input("Weight (kg)", 30, 150, 60)
            activity_level = st.selectbox("Activity level", ["inactive", "low active", "active", "very active"])
            goal = st.selectbox("Goal", ["muscle_gain", "fat_loss"])

        # Validation and account creation
        if st.button("Register"):
            if new_user in USER_DB: # Username has to be unique
                st.error("‚ùå Username already taken.")
            elif new_pass != confirm_pass: # Password must match to confirm the user correctly typed in his/her desired password
                st.error("‚ùå Passwords do not match.")
            elif len(new_user) < 3 or len(new_pass) < 4: 
                st.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è Username must be 3+ characters, password 4+.")
            else:
                # Save new user data by updating the previous user database
                USER_DB[new_user] = {
                    "password": new_pass,
                    "gender": gender,
                    "age": age,
                    "height": height,
                    "weight": weight,
                    "activity_level": activity_level,
                    "goal": goal
                }

                try:
                    with open(USER_DB_PATH, "w") as f:
                        json.dump(USER_DB, f, indent=4)
                        print("‚úÖ Saved USER_DB")
                except Exception as e:
                    st.error(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Error saving user: {e}")

                st.session_state.logged_in = True # Change the session state from not logged in to logged in
                st.session_state.user_profile = USER_DB[new_user] # Log in with the new user's profile
                st.session_state.username = new_user
                st.success("‚úÖ Registration successful! Logging you in...")
                st.rerun()

    st.stop()  # Prevent rendering other UI before login
```

### Further Explanation for Lines of Code that could be Confusing

#### Line 62 to 68
The purpose of try and except is to prevent your app from crashing if saving fails.

1. `try:`  
   Starts a try block ‚Äî this is where we put code that *might fail*.

2. `with open(USER_DB_PATH, "w") as f:`  
   Tries to open the file defined by `USER_DB_PATH` in **write mode** (`"w"`).
   - If the file doesn‚Äôt exist, Python will create it.
   - If it exists, Python will **overwrite** it.
     

3. `json.dump(USER_DB, f, indent=4)`

   The `json.dump()` is a method from Python‚Äôs built-in json module. It writes a Python object (like a dictionary or list) to a file in JSON format.

   
   In this case, it takes the `USER_DB` Python dictionary and **saves it in JSON format** to the file `f`.
   - `indent=4` makes it human-readable (pretty printed).
     

5. `print("‚úÖ Saved USER_DB")`  
   Shows a message in the terminal (not Streamlit) that saving succeeded.

6. `except Exception as e:`  
   If anything goes wrong (like the path doesn‚Äôt exist), Python jumps here.

7. `st.error(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Error saving user: {e}")`  
   Shows an error message in the **Streamlit app UI**, using the exception `e`.

8. `return`  
   Stops further execution (especially inside a function).


## Part 4 After Logged in - Logging Out

### Code Explanation

The `sidebar logout` block provides a user-friendly way to display the current login status and allow the user to log out via a sidebar interface in Streamlit.

1. It checks if both `"logged_in"` and `"username"` exist in `st.session_state`. These conditions confirm the user is logged in.

2. If the user is authenticated:
   - A welcome message is shown in the sidebar using `st.sidebar.success()`, dynamically displaying the current `username`.

3. Below the greeting, a logout button labeled `"üìú Logout"` is rendered using `st.sidebar.button()`.

4. When the logout button is clicked, the `on_click` callback triggers `st.session_state.clear()`, which removes all session variables, effectively logging the user out and resetting the app state.


```python
# --- Sidebar logout ---
if st.session_state.get("logged_in") and st.session_state.get("username"):
    st.sidebar.success(f"üëã Logged in as {st.session_state.username}")  # Welcome message
    st.sidebar.button(
        "üìú Logout", 
        on_click=lambda: st.session_state.clear()  # Clear session on logout
    )
```

## Part 5 After Logged in - The Searching Engine

### Code Explanation

This section defines the main logic flow of the app, combining user profile input, energy calculations, search functionality, and result visualization.

1. If the `user_profile` exists in `st.session_state`, it extracts the user's data fields including `gender`, `age`, `height`, `weight`, `activity_level`, and `goal`.

2. The sidebar displays the extracted profile using `st.sidebar.write()` with formatted text.

3. Energy needs are calculated using two custom functions:
   - `calculate_tee()` for Total Energy Expenditure (TEE).
   - `calculate_bmr()` for Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).
   The BMI is also computed using the standard formula.

4. The estimated time and distance required to burn 1/3 of TEE (one meal‚Äôs worth) are computed via `calories_to_exercise_with_distance()` and shown in the sidebar per activity.

5. In the main panel, users can enter a food keyword (default is `"beef"`) to search USDA‚Äôs API.

6. Once the ‚ÄúFind Foods‚Äù button is clicked:
   - Step 1: The `search_usda_foods()` function retrieves a list of `fdcIds` using the keyword.
   - Step 2: These IDs are passed to `fetch_multiple_foods()` to retrieve full nutritional data.
   - Step 3: The raw API data is processed into a structured `DataFrame` using `extract_nutrients_df()`.

7. Step 4: If the dataset contains calorie data, the app estimates how much activity is needed to burn the average calories.

8. Step 5: Using the user profile, the TEE and target macronutrients per meal are calculated. Then `score_menu()` is called to generate a weighted score for each food based on how closely it matches the user's nutritional targets.

9. The scored results are displayed in a table using `st.dataframe()` and introduced with a formatted subheader.

10. Finally, a radar chart is rendered for each food using `plot_radar_chart()`, iterating through each row and displaying the nutrient breakdown visually in two-column layout using `st.columns(2)`.



```python
# --- Input Section (for logged-in users only) ---
if "user_profile" in st.session_state:
    profile = st.session_state.user_profile

    # Extract personal info from session state
    gender = profile["gender"]
    age = profile["age"]
    height = profile["height"]
    weight = profile["weight"]
    activity_level = profile["activity_level"]
    goal = profile["goal"]

    # --- Sidebar: Display user profile and metrics ---
    st.sidebar.markdown("### üë§ Your Profile")
    st.sidebar.write(f"**üë´ Gender:** {gender}")
    st.sidebar.write(f"**üéÇ Age:** {age} years")
    st.sidebar.write(f"**üìè Height:** {height} cm")
    st.sidebar.write(f"**‚öñÔ∏è Weight:** {weight} kg")
    st.sidebar.write(f"**üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Activity Level:** {activity_level}")
    st.sidebar.write(f"**üéØ Goal:** {goal.replace('_', ' ').title()}")

    # This is later added just for the demo, it shows the usernames registered.
    st.sidebar.markdown("### üîê Show Registered Users (Dev Only)")
    st.sidebar.write("Registered usernames:")
    st.sidebar.write(list(USER_DB.keys()))

    # Calculate energy needs and activity equivalents
    tee = calculate_tee(gender, age, height, weight, activity_level)      # Total Energy Expenditure
    bmi = weight / ((height / 100) ** 2)                                   # Body Mass Index
    burn_data = calories_to_exercise_with_distance(tee / 3, bmi, age)     # Burn 1 meal worth of kcal

    bmr = calculate_bmr(gender, age, height, weight)                      # Basal Metabolic Rate

    # --- Sidebar: Display BMR and TEE results ---
    st.sidebar.markdown("### üî• Daily Energy Estimates")
    st.sidebar.write(f"**üí§ BMR:** **{round(bmr)}** kcal/day")
    st.sidebar.write(f"**üî• TEE:** **{round(tee)}** kcal/day")

    # --- Sidebar: Display burn estimates for 1/3 TEE ---
    st.sidebar.markdown("### üèÉ Burn 1 Meal (~‚Öì TEE):")
    for activity, stats in burn_data.items():
        st.sidebar.write(f"**{activity}**: {stats['time_min']} min ‚âà {stats['distance_km']} km")

    # --- Main panel: search bar ---
    st.markdown("### üîç Search Food by Keyword")
    keyword = st.text_input("Search food keyword", value="beef")  # default = "beef"
    submitted = st.button("üîé Find Foods")

    # --- Search logic begins ---
    if submitted:
        # Step 1: Search fdcIds by keyword
        fdc_ids = search_usda_foods(keyword, API_KEY)

        # Step 2: Fetch nutrient data by fdcIds
        foods = fetch_multiple_foods(fdc_ids, API_KEY)

        # Step 3: Convert to structured dataframe
        df = extract_nutrients_df(foods)

        # Step 4: (Optional) Estimate how much effort needed to burn average food calories
        if "Calories" in df.columns:
            avg_calories = df["Calories"].mean()
            bmi = weight / ((height / 100) ** 2)
            exercise_data = calories_to_exercise_with_distance(avg_calories, bmi, age)

        # Step 5: Score food based on user profile
        tee = calculate_tee(gender, age, height, weight, activity_level)
        targets = compute_target_macros_per_meal(tee)
        scored = score_menu(df, targets, tee, goal)

        # --- Output ranked results ---
        st.subheader(
            f"üèÜ Top Foods for '{keyword}' (Goal: {goal.replace('_', ' ').title()})"
        )
        st.dataframe(scored.head(10))  # Show table with ranking

        # --- Show radar charts for each food item ---
        cols = st.columns(2)  # Two-column layout for radar charts
        for i, (_, row) in enumerate(scored.head(10).iterrows()):
            with cols[i % 2]:
                st.markdown(f"#### ü•ó {row['Food']} ‚Äì {row['Brand']}")
                plot_radar_chart(row)
```

### Note

We only show the top 10 results based on our scoring system because we are also going to draw a radar chart for each item, we don't want to overwhelm the user. Also, it's unnecessary to show all 100 results after we scored the items, the whole point of scoring is to seek the top results.

### Further Explanation for Lines of Code that could be Confusing

#### Line 74 to 75
1. `scored.iterrows()` returns each row in the DataFrame as a `(index, row)` tuple.
   
2. `enumerate(...)` adds a counter `i` (0, 1, 2, ...).

3. `_` is used to ignore the original index since it's not needed. The reason it's not needed is because it has no meaning after we sort the data based on nutrient score.

4. `row` contains the actual data from the DataFrame.

5. `cols[i % 2]` alternates between `cols[0]` and `cols[1]` using the modulo operator (`% 2`), placing content in the left and right columns in turn.

6. The `with` block scopes layout content inside the chosen column.
