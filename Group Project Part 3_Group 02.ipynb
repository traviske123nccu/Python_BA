    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This function `search_usda_foods(query, api_key, max_results=100)` sends a query to the USDA FoodData Central API and returns a list of matching food item IDs (`fdcId`s) based on a search keyword. It is a core utility for initiating branded food lookups based on user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `url` variable defines the API endpoint for food search. This is a fixed URL from the USDA API that handles keyword-based food queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A dictionary named `params` is created to define the query parameters:\n",
    "   - `api_key` is required for authentication and must be passed with each request.\n",
    "   - `query` is the actual search keyword, which can be user-defined (e.g., \"beef\").\n",
    "   - `pageSize` limits the number of returned results to `max_results`, defaulting to 100.\n",
    "   - `dataType` is set to `\"Branded\"` to filter results to only branded food items (excluding generic or foundation foods).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A `GET` request is made using `requests.get()` with the URL and query parameters. The result is stored in the `response` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The function checks the HTTP response status code. If it is not `200` (indicating failure), an error message is shown in the Streamlit app using `st.error()`, and the function returns an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If the request is successful, the response is parsed as JSON, and a list comprehension extracts the `\"fdcId\"` value from each food item in the `\"foods\"` list. This list of IDs is returned to be used in downstream API calls for detailed nutrient information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this function builds and sends a properly formatted query to the USDA food database, handles failure cases gracefully, and extracts only the minimal required output — the IDs of branded foods matching the user’s search."

    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `extract_nutrients_df(food_list)` function processes a list of food item dictionaries (typically from the USDA API) and extracts selected nutrient values into a structured `pandas` DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The dictionary `key_nutrients` maps the USDA nutrient names to cleaner display labels used as column headers. This helps standardize nutrient names despite the complexity of the original API naming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The list `radar_labels` contains the target nutrient columns that should appear in every row. These labels match the values of `key_nutrients` and ensure consistency in the output DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An empty list `records` is initialized to hold the nutrient data for each food item.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The outer `for` loop iterates through each food item in `food_list`. For each food, a new dictionary `row` is initialized containing basic information: the food's description, FDC ID, and brand owner (if available).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The inner `for` loop iterates over the list of nutrients in the `\"foodNutrients\"` field of each food item. For each nutrient, it tries to retrieve the nutrient's name. If the name is found in `key_nutrients`, its corresponding amount is added to the `row` dictionary using the mapped display label.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After processing the available nutrients, the loop over `radar_labels` ensures that all expected nutrient fields are present in the `row`. If a nutrient was not extracted, `setdefault()` fills in a value of `0.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The fully populated `row` is appended to the `records` list, which accumulates the structured data for each food.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Finally, the list of dictionaries is converted into a `pandas` DataFrame using `pd.DataFrame(records)`. This structured table is returned and is ready for further scoring or visualization.\n",

    "This function plays a key role in transforming raw USDA API responses into clean, uniform tabular data for analysis and charting."

    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_tee(gender, age, height, weight, activity_level)` function estimates Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) in kilocalories per day, based on a person's physical attributes and activity level. It applies different equations depending on age group, gender, and activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function first checks the `gender`. If `gender == 'male'`, it applies formulas specifically for males; otherwise, it uses female-specific formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For males:\n",
    "   - If `age <= 2`, the function uses an infant-specific TEE formula for boys that incorporates age, height, and weight in a linear equation.\n",
    "   - If `age < 19`, the function treats the individual as a boy aged 3 to 18. The equation used depends on the `activity_level`, which can be `'inactive'`, `'low active'`, or `'active'`. If the activity level does not match any of these, a fallback formula is applied (often interpreted as \"very active\" or unspecified).\n",
    "   - If `age >= 19`, the individual is treated as an adult male. Again, different formulas are applied based on the declared `activity_level`. The constants and coefficients in each case are empirically derived and differ by activity level.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For females:\n",
    "   - If `age <= 2`, a separate infant TEE formula for girls is used, with a different set of coefficients from the male version.\n",
    "   - If `age < 19`, the function applies formulas for girls aged 3–18. Like the male counterpart, it distinguishes among `inactive`, `low active`, and `active` activity levels, with a fallback formula for other inputs.\n",
    "   - If `age >= 19`, adult women are handled with yet another set of formulas, each tailored to a different activity level.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each return statement calculates the TEE as a weighted linear combination of age, height, and weight, using different coefficients. These coefficients originate from nutritional science literature and are used to approximate metabolic requirements under various activity conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function ensures a flexible and detailed estimation of daily caloric needs by accommodating a broad range of demographics and lifestyles. Its output feeds directly into downstream processes, such as macronutrient target calculations and personalized food scoring.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Code Explanation\n",
    "The `USER_DB` initialization block handles loading and preparing user data for the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A variable `logo_url` stores the URL of an image icon used in the app’s header, which will be displayed in the Streamlit interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A variable `USER_DB_PATH` is assigned the value `\"user_db.json\"` to specify the local file used for saving and loading user data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The script checks if the file at `USER_DB_PATH` exists using `os.path.exists()`:\n",
    "   - If it exists, the file is opened in read mode and parsed using `json.load(f)` to populate the `USER_DB` dictionary.\n",
    "   - If it does not exist, a default dictionary `USER_DB` is created manually with sample users.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each user in `USER_DB` (e.g., `\"alice\"` and `\"bob\"`) contains the following fields:\n",
    "   - `\"password\"`: a plain text password for login\n",
    "   - `\"gender\"`: either `\"male\"` or `\"female\"`\n",
    "   - `\"age\"`: numeric value in years\n",
    "   - `\"height\"`: height in centimeters\n",
    "   - `\"weight\"`: weight in kilograms\n",
    "   - `\"activity_level\"`: one of `\"inactive\"`, `\"low active\"`, `\"active\"`, or `\"very active\"`\n",
    "   - `\"goal\"`: either `\"fat_loss\"` or `\"muscle_gain\"` to indicate their objective\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Line 9\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `open(USER_DB_PATH, \"r\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "    `open()` is a built-in Python function used to open a file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `\"r\"` is the mode, which stands for read. It means you want to read the file, not write to or modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `USER_DB_PATH` is the file path — in this case, `\"user_db.json\"`, which is a JSON file used to store user data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `with ... as f:`\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is Python's `with` statement, which ensures the file is properly closed after being opened — even if an error occurs.\n",

    "### Part 2 Laying Out the Page and Setting What Goes to the Header\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Streamlit setup and header display logic ensures a polished layout with branding.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `st.set_page_config(layout=\"centered\")` function configures the Streamlit page layout so that all content is centered. This enhances visual balance and makes the app look more professional on all screen sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The line `col_logo, col_title = st.columns([2, 6])` creates a layout with two columns using Streamlit’s layout API. The first column (1/4 width) is for the logo, and the second column (3/4 width) is for the title and subtitle text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside the `with col_logo:` block, the logo image stored at `logo_url` is rendered using `st.image()`, scaled to a width of 150 pixels to fit cleanly into the layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `with col_title:` block renders the following elements:\n",
    "   - `st.markdown(\"## Nutrition Scoring App 2.5.3\")`: A markdown-based header for the app title.\n",
    "   - `st.caption(\"Your personalized guide to smarter food choices!\")`: A short descriptive subtitle under the title.\n",
    "   - `st.caption(\"A Python Project Created by Group 02 with Python and Streamlit\")`: A final caption crediting the development team and tools used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3 Logging in\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `login/register` interface uses Streamlit session state to manage user authentication and persist login data across interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code first checks whether the key `\"logged_in\"` exists in `st.session_state`. If it doesn't, it initializes the login state by setting `st.session_state.logged_in = False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the user is not logged in, the app displays a login/registration form. A radio button `st.radio()` lets the user choose between `\"Login\"` and `\"Register\"` modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In `\"Login\"` mode:\n",
    "   - Two text input fields collect the `username` and `password`, with password input masked.\n",
    "   - When the `\"Login\"` button is clicked:\n",
    "     - It verifies the entered credentials by checking if the `username` exists in `USER_DB` and the stored password matches.\n",
    "     - If valid, it sets three session state variables: `logged_in`, `user_profile`, and `username`, and triggers a rerun using `st.rerun()`.\n",
    "     - If the login fails, it shows an error message using `st.error()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In `\"Register\"` mode:\n",
    "   - Three password fields are displayed to input a `username`, `new_pass`, and `confirm_pass`.\n",
    "   - Additional profile information is collected using input fields and dropdowns:\n",
    "     - `gender`, `age`, `height`, `weight`, `activity_level`, and `goal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Upon clicking `\"Register\"`:\n",
    "   - The program performs a series of checks:\n",
    "     - If the `username` already exists in `USER_DB`, show a username conflict error.\n",
    "     - If `new_pass` and `confirm_pass` do not match, show a password mismatch error.\n",
    "     - If the username is shorter than 3 characters or password shorter than 4, show a warning.\n",
    "   - If all checks pass:\n",
    "     - A new user record is added to `USER_DB` with all profile info.\n",
    "     - It tries to save `USER_DB` to disk using `json.dump()` inside a `try-except` block.\n",
    "     - On success, it updates the session state and displays a success message.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, `st.stop()` is called to prevent the rest of the app from rendering unless the user has successfully logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Explanation for Lines of Code that could be Confusing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Line 62 to 68\n",
    "The purpose of try and except is to prevent your app from crashing if saving fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `try:`  \n",
    "   Starts a try block — this is where we put code that *might fail*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `with open(USER_DB_PATH, \"w\") as f:`  \n",

    "3. `json.dump(USER_DB, f, indent=4)`\n",

    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In this case, it takes the `USER_DB` Python dictionary and **saves it in JSON format** to the file `f`.\n",

    "### Part 4 After Logged in - Logging Out\n",
    "#### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sidebar logout` block provides a user-friendly way to display the current login status and allow the user to log out via a sidebar interface in Streamlit.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It checks if both `\"logged_in\"` and `\"username\"` exist in `st.session_state`. These conditions confirm the user is logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the user is authenticated:\n",
    "   - A welcome message is shown in the sidebar using `st.sidebar.success()`, dynamically displaying the current `username`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Below the greeting, a logout button labeled `\"📜 Logout\"` is rendered using `st.sidebar.button()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When the logout button is clicked, the `on_click` callback triggers `st.session_state.clear()`, which removes all session variables, effectively logging the user out and resetting the app state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 5 After Logged in - The Searching Engine\n",
    "#### Code Explanation\n",
    "This section defines the main logic flow of the app, combining user profile input, energy calculations, search functionality, and result visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the `user_profile` exists in `st.session_state`, it extracts the user's data fields including `gender`, `age`, `height`, `weight`, `activity_level`, and `goal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The sidebar displays the extracted profile using `st.sidebar.write()` with formatted text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Energy needs are calculated using two custom functions:\n",
    "   - `calculate_tee()` for Total Energy Expenditure (TEE).\n",
    "   - `calculate_bmr()` for Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).\n",
    "   The BMI is also computed using the standard formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The estimated time and distance required to burn 1/3 of TEE (one meal’s worth) are computed via `calories_to_exercise_with_distance()` and shown in the sidebar per activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the main panel, users can enter a food keyword (default is `\"beef\"`) to search USDA’s API.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once the “Find Foods” button is clicked:\n",
    "   - Step 1: The `search_usda_foods()` function retrieves a list of `fdcIds` using the keyword.\n",
    "   - Step 2: These IDs are passed to `fetch_multiple_foods()` to retrieve full nutritional data.\n",
    "   - Step 3: The raw API data is processed into a structured `DataFrame` using `extract_nutrients_df()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Step 4: If the dataset contains calorie data, the app estimates how much activity is needed to burn the average calories.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Step 5: Using the user profile, the TEE and target macronutrients per meal are calculated. Then `score_menu()` is called to generate a weighted score for each food based on how closely it matches the user's nutritional targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The scored results are displayed in a table using `st.dataframe()` and introduced with a formatted subheader.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Finally, a radar chart is rendered for each food using `plot_radar_chart()`, iterating through each row and displaying the nutrient breakdown visually in two-column layout using `st.columns(2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "\n",
    "We only show the top 10 results based on our scoring system because we are also going to draw a radar chart for each item, we don't want to overwhelm the user. Also, it's unnecessary to show all 100 results after we scored the items, the whole point of scoring is to seek the top results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Explanation for Lines of Code that could be Confusing\n",
    "##### Line 74 to 75\n",
    "1. `scored.iterrows()` returns each row in the DataFrame as a `(index, row)` tuple.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. `enumerate(...)` adds a counter `i` (0, 1, 2, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `_` is used to ignore the original index since it's not needed. The reason it's not needed is because it has no meaning after we sort the data based on nutrient score.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `row` contains the actual data from the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `cols[i % 2]` alternates between `cols[0]` and `cols[1]` using the modulo operator (`% 2`), placing content in the left and right columns in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The `with` block scopes layout content inside the chosen column."
